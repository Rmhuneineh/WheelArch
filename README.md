# WheelArch
MATLAB GUI App giving first-attempt definitions of a vehicle wheel arch design.

An attempt to define the wheel arches of any vehicle is presented in this work. The aim is to define the shape of the wheel arches and their corresponding volume to analyze the packaging of the vehicle. In the process, a MATLABÂ® GUI application has been developed to facilitate the process for the user and to generalize the developed model for any vehicle given its corresponding required data (check Appendix). The data used to test the model correspond to a BMW X5 xDrive40i. Eventually, the 3D CAD model was developed.
